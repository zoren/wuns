the wuns programming language

the text format uses only the keys one can reach without shift

words are made of the characters from `a` to `z` digits from `0` to `9` and the characters `-` `.` `/`

square brackets `[` and `]` for lists

text with spaces can be surrounded with single quotes `'hello world'` to make them one text

line comments start with `;` and end at the end of the line

there are other characters accessible without shift `,` `=` `\` `` ` `` these are currently unused and illegal in input
