words are
-
.
/
0-9
a-z

we use square brackets[] for lists as they are accessible without shift

we allow space 0x20 as whitespace and newline 0x0a as linebreak

other characters one can reach without shift
' 0x27 singlequote, maybe use them for strings or quote
, 0x2c comma, maybe see as whitespace
; 0x3b semicolon, could use for line comments
= 0x3d equal, could use in words
\ 0x5c backslash, could use for escape sequences or character literals
` 0x60 backtick, could use for strings or quote

we don't need words to be very long, let's put an upper limit of 127 or fewer characters
